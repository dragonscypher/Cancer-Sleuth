# 🧬 Cancer Sleuth: Unraveling Colon Cancer with AI 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to **Cancer Sleuth**, where cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence meets medical science to tackle one of the most challenging diseases of our time: colon cancer. This project is a deep dive into the application of machine learning models to predict colon cancer presence from genetic information. Using a variety of algorithms, from Decision Trees to K-Nearest Neighbors, we navigate through complex data, uncover patterns, and strive for accurate predictions.

## About the Project 📖

Colon cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, is notoriously difficult to detect in its early stages. **Cancer Sleuth** aims to change the narrative by leveraging the power of machine learning. Our mission? To provide researchers and healthcare professionals with tools that can predict colon cancer more efficiently and accurately.

This repository showcases the journey of applying different machine learning techniques on colon cancer datasets, exploring how each model performs and interacts with the genetic data at our disposal.

## Datasets 📊

The heart of our analysis lies in the datasets obtained from comprehensive genetic studies. These datasets contain genetic information from patients, annotated with whether colon cancer was detected.

## Models Explored 🧠

In our quest, we delve into several models, each offering a unique perspective on the data:

- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A fundamental yet powerful model that makes decisions based on the data's attributes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: This model predicts the classification of a sample based on the majority vote of its neighbors.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A robust algorithm that finds the hyperplane which best separates the data into classes.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic model that applies Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between the features.

## Getting Started 🚀

To embark on this exploration with us, you'll need Python and several libraries, including SciKit Learn, PySpark, and others relevant to data processing and machine learning.
